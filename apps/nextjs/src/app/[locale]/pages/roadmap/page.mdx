# roadmap

here's what I'm up to with the app in the forseeable future. for the time being, I'm working on this in my free time. so be patient.

## planned features

- accessiblity improvements!! this is a big one. I'm not a pro at this, so I'm
learning as I go. if you have any suggestions, [please let me know!](mailto:strathausen@gmail.com)
- filter groups by geographical distance
- add address to groups (with lat/long)
- private groups (where membership is also private)
- "full" status for meetups
- max capacity for meetups
- waitlist for meetups
- reaction to posts
- notifications

## in progress

- profile pages
- pledge boards for meetups (who brings what? who can help with what?)

## completed

- uploading a group image

## ideas for the future

I haven't fully thought these through yet, but here are some ideas I definitely want to explore:

- a **mobile app**
- a **chat** feature
- activity feed
- follow / befriend people and see their groups / meetups
- discussions in meetups
- uploading images / image gallery
- monetization for the platform. the features as they are now will always remain
free! it might be either a *really cheap* one-time fee (maybe 50$?) or a *really cheap*, optional
subscription model (like 10$/yr) to support the development and pay for hosting. 
no ads, no selling of data, ever. [open for suggestions!](mailto:strathausen@gmail.com)

## non-goals

- charging fees for meetups. you can use [lu.ma](https://lu.ma) for that which is really great btw, cheap and pretty.
