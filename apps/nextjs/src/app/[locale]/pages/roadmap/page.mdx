# roadmap

here's what I'm up to with the app in the forseeable future. for the time being, I'm working on this in my free time. so be patient.

## planned features

- filter groups by geographical distance
- private groups (where membership is also private)
- "full" status for meetups
- max capacity for meetups
- waitlist for meetups
- reaction to posts

## in progress

- profile pages
- pledge boards for meetups (who brings what? who can help with what?)

## completed

- uploading a group image

## ideas for the future

- follow / befriend people and see their groups / meetups
- discussions in meetups
- uploading images / image gallery
- monetization for the platform. the features as they are now will always remain
free! it might be either a really cheap one-time fee or a really cheap, optional
subscription model. just to support the development and keep the lights on. 
no ads, no selling of data, no selling of features.

## non-goals

- charging fees for meetups. you can use [lu.ma](https://lu.ma) for that which is really great btw, cheap and pretty.
